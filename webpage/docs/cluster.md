# Central HPC Cluster
Information Services run a High Performance Compute (HPC) cluster called **Central**, that is available to use by all staff, students and affiliates of the University of Glasgow.

The platform and team around it have been supporting researchers in all colleges since 2014. Managed by Research Computing as a Service (RCaaS) and motivated by the needs of the community, Central is here for people with large upscaling needs but also users who are just starting their HPC journey.

## Technology
Central offers the following compute resources:

- 1020 virtual CPUS
- 8 Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU
- 2 Nvidia L40S GPUs
- Up to 16GB RAM per core

All servers of the cluster run on Oracle Linux 9. Oracle Linux is a RHEL based open-source operating system. Compute servers are provisioned with a standardised image on each reboot. This allows for easy resetting of malfunctioning nodes and expansion of new hardware.

The cluster's scheduler is the Slurm Workload Manager, developed by SchedMD. This software is crucial for HPC and helps acheive fair usage of all available compute resources.

The cluster is located in Saughfield House on the University of Glasgow Campus next to the Library building.
